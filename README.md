A Minecraft datapack to add StatTrak™ capabilities to your weapon and tools.

## Installation

To install this datapack, drag the **MC.StatTrak.(version).zip** file into your **minecraft>saves>(world name)>datapacks** folder.

## Getting Started

Stats will only be tracked when using tools with the StatTrak label.

- To apply StatTrak to your weapons, rename a name tag to "StatTrak" in an anvil. **CASE SENSITIVE!**
- Hold the renamed name tag in your hand, and it should be updated to reflect your new StatTrak add-on!
- Drop the modified name tag along with a supported tool onto an anvil. (Requires 5 levels)
- Enjoy your new StatTrak™ tool!

### Supported Tools

- Pickaxes
- Axes
- Shovels
- Swords
- Bows

## Known Issues

- Bows do not track damage dealt. This is an issue with Minecraft itself as the damage_dealt scoreboard objective [has not tracked bow stats since 1.7](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-29519).
